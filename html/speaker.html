        <div class="flex-main">

            <div class="flex-left">
                Robert Donald Cabana (born January 23, 1949) is the Associate Administrator of the National Aeronautics
                and Space Administration (NASA), a NASA astronaut (currently as a non-flight eligible management
                astronaut), and a veteran of four Space Shuttle flights. He served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from
                1994 to 1997 and as director of the John F. Kennedy Space Center from 2008 to 2021. He is also a former
                naval flight officer and naval aviator in the United States Marine Corps.
                He was born January 23, 1949, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Ted and Annabell Cabana. Ted has since moved
                to Salt Lake City. Robert is the older of two sons. His younger brother is Gary Cabana, and he is
                married to the former Nancy Joan Shimer of Cortland, New York. He has three children: Jeffrey,
                Christopher and Sarah.
                Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1985, Cabana completed initial astronaut training in
                July 1986, qualifying for assignment as a pilot on future Space Shuttle flight crews. His initial
                assignment was as the Astronaut Office Space Shuttle flight software coordinator until November 1986. At
                that time he was assigned as the deputy chief of aircraft operations for the Johnson Space Center where
                he served for 2+1⁄2 years. He then served as the lead astronaut in the Shuttle Avionics Integration
                Laboratory (SAIL) where the Orbiter's flight software is tested prior to flight. Cabana has served as a
                spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control during Space Shuttle missions, and as chief of
                astronaut appearances. Prior to his assignment to command STS-88, Cabana served three years as NASA's
                Chief of the Astronaut Office.

                Following STS-88, Cabana served as the deputy director of flight crew operations. After joining the ISS
                Program in October 1999, Cabana served as manager for international operations. From August 2001 to
                September 2002, he served as director of Human Space Flight Programs, Russia. As NASA's lead
                representative to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency (Rosaviakosmos) and its contractors, he provided
                oversight of all human space flight operations, logistics, and technical functions, including NASA's
                mission operations in Korolev and crew training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City,
                Russia.
                In October 2008 he was reassigned as director of the John F. Kennedy Space Center,[4] and served as
                director for over a decade. As a former "active" (eligible for space missions) astronaut still working
                for NASA, Cabana remains a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, as one of sixteen (as of May 2021)
                management astronauts.[5]

                On May 2021, Cabana was appointed as the Associate Administrator of NASA.[2]

        <div class="flex-main">

            <div class="flex-left">
                Elon Reeve Musk FRS is a business magnate, industrial designer, and engineer. He is the founder, CEO,
                CTO,
                and chief designer of SpaceX; early stage investor,CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of
                The
                Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. A
                centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and
                South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of
                Pretoria
                before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of
                Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
                California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career,
                co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for
                $307
                million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000
                to
                form the company PayPal and was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX,
                an
                aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO, CTO, and lead designer.
                In
                2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and
                product
                architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services
                company
                and current Tesla subsidiary. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes
                friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
                developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.
                Musk
                has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has been the subject of
                criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was
                sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in
                favor
                of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely
                tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC,
                temporarily
                stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread
                misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views
                on
                such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.

        <h1 class="speaker-name"><strong>Janet Petro</strong></h1>
        <div class="flex-main">

            <div class="flex-left">
                Janet E. Petro was named the 11th director of NASA’s John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 30,
                2021. She had been serving as acting director since May 2021 following NASA Administrator Sen. Bill
                Nelson's announcement that Robert D. Cabana, previous Kennedy director, would assume the role of NASA's
                associate administrator.

                Prior to being named director, Petro served as Kennedy’s deputy director since April 2007, where she
                shared responsibility with the center director in managing the Kennedy team of civil service and
                contractor employees, determining and implementing center policy and managing and executing Kennedy
                missions and agency program responsibilities.

                During her tenure as deputy director, Petro helped Kennedy transition into a multi-user spaceport,
                leading cross-agency initiatives with the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Air Force to
                streamline government processes and support commercial space operations to increase government
                efficiency and limit redundancy. She served a 12-month appointment at NASA Headquarters in Washington,
                D.C. as the deputy associate administrator and acting director for the Office of Evaluation. From 2017
                through January 2020, she served as the Program Executive leading the agency-wide initiative for a
                phased implementation to restructure all mission enabling functions to ensure efficient and effective
                support of NASA’s missions. Her assignment to the Mission Support Future Architecture Program (MAP)
                concluded in January 2020.

                Petro began her professional career as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army after graduating in 1981
                from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, with a Bachelor of Science degree in
                engineering. She was in the second class of West Point graduates to include women. Petro also holds a
                Master of Science degree in business administration from Boston University's Metropolitan College.

                Prior to joining NASA, Petro served in various management positions for Science Applications
                International Corp. (SAIC) and McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Corporation. At SAIC, Petro held a number of
                management positions within the corporation's operations. She interfaced with NASA, the U.S. Air Force,
                the U.S. Navy, and commercial entities on numerous aerospace and military programs. At McDonnell Douglas
                Aerospace, Petro advanced from mechanical engineer and payload manager to multiple management positions
                including program manager for executing a classified, multimillion-dollar U.S. Department of Defense
                program, to senior manager for Communications and Data Systems Division.

                CTO,
                and chief designer of SpaceX; early stage investor,CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of
                The
                Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. A
                centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and
                South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of
                Pretoria
                before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of
                Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
                California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career,
                co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for
                $307
                million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000
                to
                form the company PayPal and was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX,
                an
                aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO, CTO, and lead designer.
                In
                2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and
                product
                architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services
                company
                and current Tesla subsidiary. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes
                friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
                developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.
                Musk
                has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has been the subject of
                criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was
                sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in
                favor
                of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely
                tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC,
                temporarily
                stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread
                misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views
