                Elon Reeve Musk FRS is a business magnate, industrial designer, and engineer. He is the founder, CEO,
                CTO,
                and chief designer of SpaceX; early stage investor,CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of
                The
                Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. A
                centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and
                South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of
                Pretoria
                before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of
                Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
                California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career,
                co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for
                $307
                million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000
                to
                form the company PayPal and was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX,
                an
                aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO, CTO, and lead designer.
                In
                2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and
                product
                architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services
                company
                and current Tesla subsidiary. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes
                friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
                developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.
                Musk
                has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has been the subject of
                criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was
                sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in
                favor
                of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely
                tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC,
                temporarily
                stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread
                misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views
                on
                such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.

                Musk
                has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has been the subject of
                criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was
                sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in
                favor
                of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely
                tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC,
                temporarily
                stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread
                misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views
                on
                such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.
