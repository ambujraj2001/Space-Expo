            Elon Reeve Musk FRS is a business magnate, industrial designer, and engineer. He is the founder, CEO, CTO,
            and chief designer of SpaceX; early stage investor,CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The
            Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. A
            centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and
            South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria
            before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of
            Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
            California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career,
            co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307
            million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to
            form the company PayPal and was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an
            aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO, CTO, and lead designer. In
            2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product
            architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company
            and current Tesla subsidiary. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes
            friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
            developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk
            has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has been the subject of
            criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was
            sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in favor
            of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely
            tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily
            stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread
            misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views on
            such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.
